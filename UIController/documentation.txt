BEFORE YOU READ
--------------------------------------------
There are some configurations that needs to be made in order to
use this module.
I'm going to describe them√in the following lines.

--------------------------------------------
X SERVER
--------------------------------------------
You'll need xorg-server installed to run this module since it's
a graphic module based on X.

You need to run your module that uses this module with an X server running.
To do that you need to run:

startx

If you want to run your module just after the X server, you'll need to edit
the file /home/yourUserName/.xinitrc and add the following line:

exec python (absolutePathOfYourModule)

If you want to have no cursors displayed, you need to run:

startx -- -nocursor

Instead of:

startx

---------------------------------------------
MONITOR CONFIGURATIONS
---------------------------------------------
If you want to have no black borders along the monitor and if you need
to rotate the display, you'll need to change add some configurations on
the file /boot/config.txt
You'll need to add these lines:

disable_overscan=1 		//removes black borders

display_rotate=3		//rotate the display of 270 degrees clockwise
